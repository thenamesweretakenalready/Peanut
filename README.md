# Peanut
Peanut will be an object-oriented, statically typed language. The aim is for it to be both compiled and interpreted - you may either interpret code (useful when testing), or you can compile (ideal for release). Currently Peanut is Turing Complete but nowhere near finished. The compiler is written in Python and compiles to Python. Upon completion Peanut will compile to machine code, but I am just a small bean, and I know not what the fuck I am supposed to do there.
